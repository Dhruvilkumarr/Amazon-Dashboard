## Problem Statement

The Prime Video platform hosts a vast array of content, including movies and TV shows, spanning various genres, ratings, and regions. However, there is a need to understand how this content is distributed and how it performs across different categories. This understanding is crucial for making informed decisions about content acquisition and marketing strategies.

To address this need, we propose an in-depth analysis of Prime Videoâ€™s content distribution. This analysis will focus on identifying trends in viewer preferences over time, examining the performance of different genres and ratings, and exploring regional variations in content consumption. By leveraging data visualizations, we aim to uncover insights that can guide strategic decisions and enhance the overall viewer experience.

Ultimately, the goal is to enable Prime Video to optimize its content library and marketing efforts. By understanding what types of content resonate most with viewers, Prime Video can tailor its offerings to meet audience demands more effectively. This data-driven approach will not only improve viewer satisfaction but also drive growth and engagement on the platform.
